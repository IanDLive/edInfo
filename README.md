Elite: Dangerous module for the PhantomBot chat bot (derived from ClangNet Suite)

The module itself is dependent on the app EDDiscovery being used while Elite is being played, as the app has the ability to read the
journal file of the game and output certain bits of information for use with an OBS overlay.  These text files are what this module uses
as its information source so that the data that it uses is as dynamic as possible.
